Machine Learning Project 1 : 

Higgs Boson:
This machine learning project makes predictions on a data set of Higgs Boson particules. 

Pre processing of the data:
Processing is key to reveal the information that lies within the data. You can find all the process in the pre_processing.py file.

The steps are the following:
Load the data set and separate the ids and the classification feature from the others.
Fill in the missing values and correlated features.
Standardising the data.
Use of machine learning methods


We implemented 6 different methods of machine learning in the implementation.py file :

Linear regression with gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent with learning rate gamma.
Least squares.
Ridge regression with hyper parameter lambda.
Logistic and regularized logistic regression with hyper parameter lambda and learning rate gamma.
The best values for the parameters were determined by cross validation in the project1.ipynb. Of all the methods, we found that the ridge regression one was the most accurate.

Run the script
You can run the run.ipynb to compute the result.csv which is the best classification we can make of the test data set. You will need the train dataset in a directory named resources next to the script one. Run it from inside the script directory.

It uses the pre processing and the ridge regression method discussed above. The hyper parameter lambda and the degree used for the polynomial expansion were determined by cross validation. They are the best values we got, it gives an accuracy of 83.33 % on the test data set.
